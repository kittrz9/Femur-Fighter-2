# Femur Fighter 2
A remake (sequel?) of the dumb fighting game I made as a joke in 2019 (https://github.com/kittrz9/Femur-Fighter)

Yes I know everything about this is trash

## Controls
Pause: Escape<br>
Confirm in menus: Enter<br>

<b>Player 1:<br></b>
Left: A<br>
Right: D<br>
Jump: W<br>
Fastfall: S<br>
Dash left: Q<br>
Dash right: E<br>

<b>Player 2:<br></b>
Left: Numpad 4<br>
Right: Numpad 6<br>
Jump: Numpad 8<br>
Fastfall: Numpad 5<br>
Dash left: Numpad 7<br>
Dash right: Numpad 9<br>

Controls are configurable in the config file (~/.local/share/kittrz/FemurFighter2/config.txt for Linux, idk for anything else because I havent tested it on anything else but it prints the path to the console when launching from the commandline) or in the controls menu

## Compiling
You should just be able to install SDL2 (Using either the download at https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php if you're on Windows or just whatever package manager you use in Linux) and run the makefile


I havent tested it on anything other than just my own computer with Linux so I can't guarentee it will work on like Windows or Mac 

## Things I should probably add
 - Sound<br>
 - Timer<br>
 - More attacks than just dashing<br>
 - Optimizing stuff<br>
 - Alternate costumes/characters?<br>
 - Better art<br>
 - Better controls<br>
 - Being able to change resolution<br>
 - Fix "missing braces around initializer" warning when compiling<br>
 - Fix menu confirm sometimes not being assigned a control from the config file<br>
 - Organize stuff better<br>
 - Maybe start using CMake instead of just regular make files<br>
 - Make the menus look good<br>
 - Music<br>
 - Controller support<br>
 - Include images in the executable so you dont need the res folder<br>
 - Online multiplayer ~~(Never gonna happen)~~ (might actually happen lmao)<br>
 - Make the game actually good ***(NEVER gonna happen)***<br>
