# Femur Fighter 2
A remake (sequel?) of the dumb fighting game I made as a joke in 2019 (https://github.com/kittrz9/Femur-Fighter)

Yes I know everything about this is trash

## Controls
<b>Player 1:<br></b>
Left: A<br>
Right: D<br>
Jump: W<br>
Fastfall: S<br>
Dash left: Q<br>
Dash right: E<br>

<b>Player 2:<br></b>
Left: Numpad 4<br>
Right: Numpad 6<br>
Jump: Numpad 8<br>
Fastfall: Numpad 5<br>
Dash left: Numpad 7<br>
Dash right: Numpad 9<br>

Hopefully eventually I might make controls configurable in a config file or the game but as of now you would need to recompile the game to change them

## Compiling
You should just be able to install SDL2 (Using either the download at https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php if you're on Windows or just whatever package manager you use in Linux) and run the makefile


I havent tested it on anything other than just my own computer with Linux so I can't guarentee it will work on like Windows or Mac 

## Things I should probably add
`Sound`<br>
`Timer`<br>
`More attacks than just dashing`<br>
`Optimizing stuff`<br>
`Controls configuration`<br>
`Just a way to configure stuff in general`<br>
`Alternate costumes/characters?`<br>
`Better art`<br>
`Better controls`<br>
`Make the menus look good`<br>
`Music`<br>
`Controller support`<br>
`Online multiplayer (Never gonna happen)`<br>
`Make the game actually good (NEVER gonna happen)`<br>
